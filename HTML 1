<h2 style="color: brown">Things that went well</h2>
<ol>
        <li>I was well welcomed with by Akirachix alumni</li>
        <li>I love the bedroom arrangement and neatness of the bed</li>
        <li>I liked the way the care-takers were willing to guide as on everything we are not familiar with</li>
        <li>I enjoyed tasting different dishes of delicous food serve</li>
    </ol>
</p>
<p>
    <h2 style="color: brown">Things that did not necessarily go well</h2>
    <span>Around them on same line</span>
    <span>And we still move</span>
    
    <ul>
        <li>The weather was so cold</li>
        <li>There is one dish I tried and it messed with my stomach</li>
        <li>It was somehow challenging to clean the washroom very well before going to class</li>
        <li>For first time, it was difficult for me to arrange wardrobe</li>

   <h3 <!-- then we walked --> We moved too fast</h3>
